find way of reducing memory use by running one region (or even chunk) at a time
    idea: foldM write $ map (\chunk -> (chunk, n, e, s, w)) chunks

parallelize program by making chunkGeom world -> Coord -> ByteString, parMapping chunkGeom over chunks (using dph-base or repa)
    and B.concatting at the end
