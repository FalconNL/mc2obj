mc2obj v0.2
===========

mc2obj is a tool to convert part of a Minecraft world to a .obj file, which
can be imported into a 3D package such as 3ds max or Blender to make a
rendering of that world.

mc2obj is similar to mcobj (https://github.com/quag/mcobj), with the following
differences:

* It automatically generates texture coordinates and applies textures
* It generates correct geometry, not just blocks (NOTE: not implemented yet)

mc2obj is still in the early stages of development, so it is not yet usable
unless you know Haskell. Currently supported:

* Converting a group of chunks to .obj format with reasonable speed
* Materials for naturally occurring blocks
* Geometry for naturally occurring full blocks

Below is a teaser shot of a single chunk:
